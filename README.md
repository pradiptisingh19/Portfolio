# Personal Portfolio Website

This is my portfolio website built using HTML and CSS.  
It’s a single-page site designed to quickly showcase my skills, projects, and a bit about me — all in one scroll-friendly view.

I chose to keep it simple and lightweight, so I didn’t use React or JavaScript, making it easy to load, read, and navigate.
